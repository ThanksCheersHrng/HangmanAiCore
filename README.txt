## 1. Overview

Basically I'm creating a game of Hangman by following instructions on AiCore's teaching platform. The project aim is to combine and 
consolidate what I've learned so far on AiCore into a functional activity.
I have used file manipulation in GitBash, Python coding (in VSCode, despite Spyder being *chef's kiss*), and git and GitHub to submit this project online. 
So far I haven't learned anything new by completing this project, but I have revised quite a few little things. For instance:
 - mv is the git bash command for moving a file from one directory 
 - README.txt is a markdown file so I can use the same formatting codes as in RMarkdown (with which I am more familiar) 
 - string.lower() will turn every letter in string to lowercase 

## 2. Installation instructions

To run the Hangman game I've created, I think you'll just be interested in my python file, milestone_2.py (named according to AiCore's directions). 
I don't think it's complicated. git pull my directory () to your device, then run milestone_2.py to play the game. 




## 3. Usage instructions

Run milestone_2.py to play a game of Hangman. If you don't know how that game works, here's the general idea: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman
