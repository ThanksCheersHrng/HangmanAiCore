## 1. Overview

Basically I'm creating a game of Hangman by following instructions on AiCore's teaching platform. The project aim is to combine and 
consolidate what I've learned so far on AiCore into a functional activity.
I have used file manipulation in GitBash, Python coding (in VSCode, despite Spyder being \**chef's kiss*\*), and git and GitHub to submit this project online. 
So far I haven't learned anything new by completing this project, but I have revised quite a few little things. For instance:
 - mv is the git bash command for moving a file from one directory 
 - README.txt is a markdown file so I can use the same formatting codes as in RMarkdown (with which I am more familiar) 
 - string.lower() will turn every letter in string to lowercase 

Within this repo are the following files: 

 - README.md (this file)
 - README.txt (an older version of README that you can ignore)
 - milestone\_2.py (an initial piece of code named according to AiCore's instructions) 
 - milestone\_3.py (a more developed piece of code on which you can run a single turn of Hangman) 
 - milestone\_4.py (an encapsulation of the work so far, folded into a class called Hangman) 

## 2. Installation instructions

To install this game of Hangman, pull this repo or simply copy and paste milestone\_3.py into your own file. 


## 3. Usage instructions

Run milestone\_\?.py to play a game of Hangman. If you don't know how that game works, here's the general idea: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman


## 4. File structure

At this stage there is no directory hierarchy. There is simply the Hangman folder which contains all relevant documents. 

The structure of milestone\_3.py is as follows:

 - import random 
 - select a random word from a list 
 - define check\_guess function 
 - define ask\_for\_input function
 - call ask\_for\_input function. 


## 5. License information

This code is following step-by-step instructions from AiCore, so credit for code development goes to them. Anyone is welcome to use this code to help their learning.
